              <h4>At some point in March (sounds about right), Plasmo found an old crypt full of inp's that old players shared to show their replays.
                  Believe it or not, people actually used these things. Pearl has since tried to get as many working as possible.
                  Together, they started a show called Average Super Players Enjoy, showing all the replays they got working.
                  The show can be found on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pearl_" target="_blank">Pearl</a>'s Twitch channel around Wednesday 2am EST / 6am GMT. 
                  Maybe you'll even be awake while one of the episodes is airing.
                  <br>
                  <br>Besides the show, ASE has also become a <del>circlejerk</del> team.
